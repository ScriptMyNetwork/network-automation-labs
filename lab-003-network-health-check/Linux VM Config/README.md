Static IP Setup will be the same as the Previous lab's setup. Please refer to LAB 001 - Linux VM Config - Static IP text file

If SSH Cipher mismatch error appears then refer to Linux VM Config - SSH Cipher Error text file

Note - To use Netmiko in new directory we need to install it again in the new Directory, if you are using same folder as Lab001/002 you can skip this step
