# Network Automation Labs

Hands-on network automation labs for network engineers using Python, Terraform, and AI-driven techniques.

This repository contains practical, real-world automation labs designed to help
network engineers move from manual CLI operations to scalable, repeatable, and
vendor-neutral automation workflows.

All labs are built with an enterprise mindset and focus on how automation is
implemented in real production environments.

---

## What You Will Learn

- Automating day-to-day network operations using Python
- Managing and validating configurations across multiple devices
- Designing safe, repeatable automation workflows
- Infrastructure as Code concepts using Terraform for networking
- Vendor-neutral automation principles applicable across environments
- Using AI-assisted approaches to improve automation efficiency
- Thinking like a Network Automation Engineer, not just a script writer

---

## Technologies & Tools Covered

- Python (Netmiko, YAML, automation best practices)
- Terraform (network Infrastructure as Code concepts)
- Multi-vendor network automation principles
- CLI-based automation workflows
- AI-assisted automation concepts for network operations
- Lab platforms such as EVE-NG and GNS3

---

## Lab Design Philosophy

Each lab is designed to reflect real operational scenarios and includes:
- A real-world problem statement
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Automation scripts and configuration files
- Validation and expected outputs
- Common mistakes and troubleshooting notes
- Enterprise-style workflow separation (push, validate, commit)

---

## Target Audience

- NOC Engineers (L1 / L2) transitioning to automation
- Network Engineers adopting Python and Infrastructure as Code
- Engineers preparing for automation-focused roles
- CCNA / CCNP engineers building real-world automation skills

---

## Disclaimer

These labs are intended for learning and skill development.
All scripts and configurations should be tested in lab environments
before being applied to production networks.
