AI Decision Intelligence Lab (LAB-007)

This project implements an AI-powered Organizational Decision Memory and Change Risk Intelligence system.

The platform:

Stores infrastructure and operations decisions

Builds relationships between decisions (knowledge graph)

Uses AI to explain why decisions were made

Predicts impact and risk of architectural changes

Provides a chat-style interface for IT and Network teams

Example Scenario

In the EVE-NG lab:

Dual ISP topology is designed between sites

Static route workaround added during failover issue

System understands dependency between architecture and workaround

AI explains risks such as routing asymmetry and blackholing

This demonstrates how the system acts as organizational memory + change risk intelligence.
