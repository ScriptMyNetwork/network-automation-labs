1) SSH Cipher Error between Ubuntu VM and Legacy Cisco IOS versions

   Follow SSH-Cipher-Error.txt in Linux VM Config to resolve this

2) Internet Reachability 

   Ensure you have a 2nd NIC with DHCP enabled and connect to Management Cloud or Bridge Depending on how you have setup your VM.
   If no 2nd NIC feasibility, then connect internet to L2/L3 Switch and change config accordingly

3) Netmiko/PYyaml Install issues

   Create a venv as mentioned in the Library Install section and this will help to resolve this

4) Unable to copy script to EVE NG

   Create the .py and .yaml file locally on your desktop   
   Use WinSCP and connect to your Linux VM - DHCP IP, use the same credentials you use to login to the VM
   Trasnfer the files to the lab directory that you created i.e. /network-automation/lab-001
   It will be easier to navigate and copy using Winscp
   Once copied, login to Linux VM and go to the lab directory, type  - ls
   This will list the files and if you can see the file you need then it is copied
